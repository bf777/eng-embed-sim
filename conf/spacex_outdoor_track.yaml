# This is an overlay for the main config. It won't work by itself -- just put the main config before this one in the args to sim.py or gui.py
# How to use:  python src/sim.py conf/sim_config.yaml conf/spacex_outdoor_track.yaml
# (^ later configs overlay previous ones, so spacex_outdoor_track.yaml overlays on top of conf/sim_config.yaml)
